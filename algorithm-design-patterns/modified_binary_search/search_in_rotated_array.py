"""
Given an array of numbers which is sorted in ascending order and also rotated by some arbitrary number, 
find if a given ‘key’ is present in it.

Write a function to return the index of the ‘key’ in the rotated array. If the ‘key’ is not present, return -1.
 You can assume that the given array does not have any duplicates.

Example 1:

Input: [10, 15, 1, 3, 8], key = 15
Output: 1
Explanation: '15' is present in the array at index '1'.

Example 2:

Input: [4, 5, 7, 9, 10, -1, 2], key = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: '10' is present in the array at index '4'.
