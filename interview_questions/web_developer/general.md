## Q2. What is Namespacing in JavaScript?

Ans. It is usually not a good practice to use global variables in programming languages including JavaScript. 
However, you may be forced to use global variables sometimes. So, JavaScript introduces the concept of namespacing
which ties down a part of the code and register it with a unique name.
